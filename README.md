# VBA Stock Analysis Challenge.
## Overview of Project
We are trying to help Steve create a faster macro by refactoring our pre-existing macro. In our previous macro, we used a nested loop which had to go through +3000 rows of data 11 times! With this in mind, we wanted to find a faster and more efficient way to loop through all the rows and still get the yearly volume and return for each and every stock in our data set. 
## Results
The results of the refactoring of the macro was successful. From our **VBA_Challenge_2017.png** and **VBA_Challenge_2018.png**, our macro worked almost half the time it did with our previous macro, which took more than a second for both the 2017 data set and our 2018 data set.
## Summary
The advantages of refactoring code in general is that we are able to consume less time in running the codes and will be able to get faster results than other people. This may be useful when we work in a field where processing data faster may give us an advantage to other competitors. The disadvandate of refactoring code in general is that it take time and good understanding of the previous code in order to successfully run the refactored code.

The advantages of refactoring VBA script is that we are able to get the results of our code quicker and will allow our computers to use less memory to run our code. The disadvantage of refactoring in VBA script is that it takes enough knowledge and time to understand what can be refactored and what cannot. It is important to keep in mind what is the code in hand and how to make it simpler is sometimes easier said than done.
